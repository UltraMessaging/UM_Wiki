Why not just use the Wiki feature that GitHub provides?

1. GitHub prevents search engines (Google, etc.) from crawling wikis except under certain circumstances ("[Note: Search engines will only index wikis with 500 or more stars that you configure to prevent public editing.](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)").
2. The web-based editor has limited capabilities. If you are creating a significant article, it is very useful to use a proper text editor (vi, emacs, etc.). It is possible but more difficult to access the Wiki files - requires command-line Git; can't use the desktop app. It presents an obstacle.
3. Closely related, it is sometimes nice to make the same edits across a large number of files (sed, perl, etc.). Again, it's possible but more difficult to access the Wiki files.
